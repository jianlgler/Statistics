# What's a Distribution?

The distribution of a variable is a description of the relative numbers of times each possible outcome will occur in a number of trials. The function describing the probability that a given value will occur is called the probability density function (abbreviated PDF), and the function describing the cumulative probability that a given value or any value smaller than it will occur is called the distribution function (or cumulative distribution function, abbreviated CDF)[^1].

Formally, a distribution can be defined as a normalized measure, and the distribution of a random variable x is the measure P_x on S^' defined by setting

where (S, S^, P) is a probability space, (S, S^) si a measurable space, and P a measure on S^ with P(S) = 1. If the measure is a Radon measure (which is usually the case), then the statistical distribution is a generalized function in the sense of a generalized function[^2].
