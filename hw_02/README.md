# What's a Distribution?

The distribution of a variable is a description of the relative numbers of times each possible outcome will occur in a number of trials. The function describing the probability that a given value will occur is called the probability density function (abbreviated PDF), and the function describing the cumulative probability that a given value or any value smaller than it will occur is called the distribution function (or cumulative distribution function, abbreviated CDF)[^1].

Formally, a distribution can be defined as a normalized measure, and the distribution of a random variable x is the measure P_x on S^' defined by setting

where (S, S^, P) is a probability space, (S, S^) si a measurable space, and P a measure on S^ with P(S) = 1. If the measure is a Radon measure (which is usually the case), then the statistical distribution is a generalized function in the sense of a generalized function[^2].

## Univariate Distribution

In statistics, a univariate distribution is a probability distribution of only one random variable. This is in contrast to a multivariate distribution, the probability distribution of a random vector (consisting of multiple random variables).
One of the simplest examples of a discrete univariate distribution is the discrete uniform distribution, where all elements of a finite set are equally likely. It is the probability model for the outcomes of tossing a fair coin, rolling a fair die, etc. The univariate continuous uniform distribution on an interval [a, b] has the property that all sub-intervals of the same length are equally likely[^3]. 
At least 750 univariate discrete distributions have been reported in the literature[^4], examples include the binomial, geometric, negative binomial, and Poisson distributions[^5].
Examples of commonly applied continuous univariate distributions[^6] include the normal distribution, Student's t distribution, chisquare distribution, F distribution, exponential and gamma distributions.
