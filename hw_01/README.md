# What is Statistics?
According to Wikipedia[^1], Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, snalisys, interpretation and presentation of data.

In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population[^2] or a statistical model[^3] to be studied. 

## Is it a science? 
Well, according to a related Quora thread[^4], the standard definition of “science” is “the systematic enterprise that builds and knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe”[^5].

However, the standard view of pure mathematics is that it exists independent of the physical and natural world, and is investigated by logic, rather than observation and experiment, and so we can say that maths is not a science itself, but can be considered an abstraction of reality. 

If we accept this definition of pure mathematics, we can assume that statistics has both some non-scientific pure mathematics and some scientific study. 
For example an introductory statistics course will generally include computation of binomial probabilities under ideal assumption (pure mathematics) and also data analisys: techniques that have been found generally usefull in real application[^6]. 

Most data analysis techniques do have theoretical justifications, which were generally developed after the techniques has been discovered empirically and were in wide practice, and often there are multiple theoretical justifications for the same technique. So someone might claim that the field of statistics is pure mathematics. 

We can conclude by saying that there are different opinions on this topic and so finding a correct answer might be difficoult.

# What is a dataset? From the observation units to the dataset attributes and values

The Latin word data is the plural of 'datum', "(thing) given," neuter past participle of dare "to give"[^7][^8].

So data is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted. A datum is an individual state in a set of data. Data usually is organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, and which may themselves be used as data in larger structures. They may be used as variables in a computational[^9] process, or represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements[^10]. Data is commonly used in scientific research, finance, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity. Examples of data sets include stock prices, crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates, and census data[^7].

Data, as a general concept, refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing and is the smallest units of factual information that can be used as a basis for calculation, reasoning, or discussion. Data can range from abstract ideas to concrete measurements, including but not limited to, statistics. Thematically connected data presented in some relevant context can be viewed as information[^7]. 

Ok so a dataset is a collection of data: it can corresponds to one or more database tables, or any other collection of documents or files[^10].

## What's a so called statistical unit?

In statistics, a unit is one member of a set of entities being studied. It is the main source for the mathematical abstraction of a "random variable". Common examples of a unit would be a single person, animal, plant, manufactured item, or country that belongs to a larger collection of such entities being studied[^12]. 
Units are often referred to as being either experimental units and sampling units (or unit of observation):

-An "experimental unit" is typically thought of as one member of a set of objects that are initially equal, with each object then subjected to one of several experimental treatments. Put simply, it is the smallest entity to which a treatment is applied.

-A "sampling unit" is typically thought of as an object that has been sampled from a statistical population. This term is commonly used in opinion polling and survey sampling.

For example, in an experiment on educational methods, methods may be applied to classrooms of students. This would make the classroom as the experimental unit. Measurements of progress may be obtained from individual students, as observational units. But the treatment (teaching method) being applied to the class would not be applied independently to the individual students. Hence the student could not be regarded as the experimental unit. The class, or the teacher by method combination if the teacher had multiple classes, would be the appropriate experimental unit[^12].
