# What is Statistics?
According to Wikipedia[^1], Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, snalisys, interpretation and presentation of data.

In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population[^2] or a statistical model[^3] to be studied. 

Is it a science? 
Well, according to a related Quora thread[^4], the standard definition of “science” is “the systematic enterprise that builds and knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe”[^5].

However, the standard view of pure mathematics is that it exists independent of the physical and natural world, and is investigated by logic, rather than observation and experiment, and so we can say that maths is not a science itself, but can be considered an abstraction of reality. 

If we accept this definition of pure mathematics, we can assume that statistics has both some non-scientific pure mathematics and some scientific study. 
For example an introductory statistics course will generally include computation of binomial probabilities under ideal assumption (pure mathematics) and also data analisys: techniques that have been found generally usefull in real application. 

Most data analysis techniques do have theoretical justifications, which were generally developed after the techniques has been discovered empirically and were in wide practice, and often there are multiple theoretical justifications for the same technique. So someone might claim that the field of statistics is pure mathematics.
