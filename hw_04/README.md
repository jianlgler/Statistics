# Parallels between relative frequency and the axioms for probability

Andrey Kolmogorov was a Russian mathematician. In 1933, he contribuited to probability theory introducing his axioms: they are known today as probability theory fundamentals by the name of Kolmogorov axioms.

## First Axiom

The probability of an event is a non-negative real number:
:<math>P(E)\in\mathbb{R}, P(E)\geq 0 \qquad \forall E \in F</math>

where <math>F</math> is the event space. It follows that <math>P(E)</math> is always finite, in contrast with more general [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]].  Theories which assign [[negative probability]] relax the first axiom.
