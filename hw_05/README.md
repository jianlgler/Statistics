# Arithmetic Mean: Derivations and Generalization

In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection[^1].
Its formula is: $$(1/n)*\sum_{i=1}^{n }\ a_{i}$$

The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. Actually mean functions tend to represent the whole set of values with a single number...its about synthesis of the population.
Arithmetic mean is just one of the many different function used to analyze distriubtion and with it follow some derivations:

## Geometric Mean

The geometric mean is a mean or average which indicates a central tendency of a set of numbers by using the product of their values [^2] (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum). The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers, i.e., for a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn, the geometric mean is defined as
