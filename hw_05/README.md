# Arithmetic Mean: Derivations and Generalization

In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection[^1].
Its formula is: $$(1/n)*\sum_{i=1}^{n }\ a_{i}$$

The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency.
