# Conditional Frequency

In a contingency table (sometimes called a two way frequency table), conditional frequency is a fraction that tells you how many members of a group have a particular characteristic. More technically, it is the ratio of a frequency in the center of the table to the frequency’s row total or column total[^1]. 
To be clearer, a conditional distribution is a univariate distribution, composed by its frequency, built on the costraint of a value. 
It refers to a subset of the whole population.

# Joint Frequency

In a bivariate distribution, given the variables X and Y, the joint frequency represents the number of statistical units which have X_i value and Y_j value at the same time. 
To simplify: A joint frequency is how many times a combination of two conditions happens together. For example a dog owner who is also a woman[^2].

# Marginal Frequency 

It is the ratio between the frequency of a row total or column total to the total frequency of the data. It is commonly used to analyze general trends in one specific category of data[^3].
To simplify: A marginal frequency can be calculated by dividing a row total or a column total by the total frequency of the data[^4].
