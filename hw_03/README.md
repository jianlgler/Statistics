# Joint Frequency

In a bivariate distribution, given the variables X and Y, the joint frequency represents the number of statistical units which have X_i value and Y_j value at the same time. 
To simplify: A joint frequency is how many times a combination of two conditions happens together. For example a dog owner who is also a woman[^1].

# Marginal frequency 

It is the ratio between the frequency of a row total or column total to the total frequency of the data. It is commonly used to analyze general trends in one specific category of data[^2].
To simplify: A marginal frequency can be calculated by dividing a row total or a column total by the total frequency of the data[^3].
