## HW_2

* Research
1. Definition of distribution

* Application
1. Make a simple demo program which uses the objects RANDOM and TIMER in C# and VB.NET
2. Make a simple CSV parser that can ead a CSV file
3. Compute a univariate distribution of a variable after reading a variable from a CSV file

* Research on App
1. Summarize the main aspects of the CSV protocol RFC 4180 (definition and rules)

## HW_3

* Research
1. Illustrate the concept of conditional, joint, marginal (relative) frequency using a simple bivariate distribution
2. Illustrate the concept of statistical independence and the resulting mathematical relationships between the above frequencies

* Application
1. Create a distribution from the data obtained by the sniffer Wireshark by reading the CSV file or realtime data generated by the program
[optional: create a bivariate distribution]

* Research on App
1. A survey on ONLINE algorithms (mean, variance, median, etc...)
2. Illustrate in particular, Knuth recursion for the computation of the arithmetic mean or average, discussion why it is preferable to the "naive" algo

- [Theory Link](https://jianlgler.github.io/Statistics/hw_03/)

## HW_4

* Research
1. Illustrate the parallels, between the properties of the relative frequency and the axioms for probability
2. Discuss some concrete examples of Probability measure Space
3. Illustrate how Measure Theory provides the mathematical foundation for Probability Theory

* Application
1. Generate a m sequences of n trials distributed according a Binomial with success probability p and represent the following quantities: absolute frequency of success, relative frequency of success, "normalized" relative frequency of success.
2. In the same chart, add also a vertical histogram representing the distribution of the above 3 types of frequencies on the last trial.

* Research on App
1. Give a simple introduction to graphics in the .NET environment. How to create a bitmap and a chart on it.
2. Explain in simple terms how to get device coordinates from world coordinates
